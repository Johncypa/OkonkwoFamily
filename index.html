      <blockquote>The <b>Toxic</b> Family</blockquote>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The year i was born till now has been as caotic a one could imagine. i
      can't vividly a day i was happy genuinly except if food was involde.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Since October 9th this Family has faced multiple arguement than one ould
      count.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm talking about mostly them reseuting in <i>fights</i>, verbal abuse,
      and insults. This fight made us say things we never meant, do things we
      neev would have never done.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Each and everyone of us where put in a siyuation where we couldn't breath
      but outside the arguements and fights lay a beautiful Family, a Family
      where everyone has different power, abililty and Blessings.

    <h4><blockquote>My Father</blockquote></h4>
    <p>
      My Father is an incredible man who also wants his children to have a
      peaceful Life. Regardless of everything we are going through, but this
      father of mine doesnt understand his children and wants us to be perfect
      at everything but here's the catch nobody is perfect. A solution for him
      is that he should stop thinking like an old man from the 1900's but like a
      young man because he has children of young generation
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4><blockquote>My Mother</blockquote></h4>
    <p>
      Now, my Mother, hmmmm i have too much to say about her, I Love her but i
      ask yself iff shes atually my Mother because to me i didn't grow up with
      any parent, the only way they impacted in my life is in terms money
      bacause as far back as i can remember my Mom has caused me more pain than
      she has caused me happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Mother shouts too much, she asks sommetimes too much questions and
      she's very judgemental and she doesn't understand her own children except
      the first boy (John) in my eyes if they were to point a Gun at my Whole
      Family and they ask my Mum who to release she would say my brother and you
      know why because he gives her money, he spoils her but you know the funny
      thinng i never noticed this till he came back to Nigeria last year 9th
      October (as the coder and John correction i came back to Nigeria 28th of
      October.)
    </p>
    <p>
      . But what can i say she never loved me or my Sisters from the start she
      always have something bad about us. But i pity Amoge the most because if
      feels like she's alone in this world thats why anytime My Mom and Brother
      are always on her neck i try to defend her she's trying but they dont want
      to understand that.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Mother s always telling us the things she's done for us especially my
      sisters but my Dad has done more things than we could coun but he never
      reminds us,
    </p>
    <p>
      He never rubs it on our face how much he's spent on us or how much he
      loves us even while he was in prison but my Mom even when she just buys
      one shoe for us she'll remind us about everything she's done for us right
      from birth
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      It's so painful we love her but she has never showed us how she love us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We didnt as to be in this family or their children So why does sh always
      monitarize us, why?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We are her Children she gave birth to us we didnt ask her to be our
      mother, so why does she treat us like this, we are some mistakes sometimes
      i think i'm adopted because i look nothing like her. Me and My sisters, we
      never ask her for anything, we hardly ask her for money so why does she
      treat us different from John why? and now i am Thinking it might because
      he gave her a Grandchild but if we were to give her a child she would
      disown us
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      My brother disvirgined at the age of 20, if my sisters right now where to
      just like a man oooo not to even have sex with them, my mother will
      pratically kill them,
    </p>
    <p>
      now im starting to think she's our problem because she's holding us down.
      I just want to know why she treats us like this way. Why? All i've ever
      prayed for was to have a happy Family even though we'll be poor all ive
      assked for is to be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When i told her i wanted to go o the gostel she didn't even ask me why she
      just told i'm not going anywhere. If i think about it i dont have a Home
      because, A home is a happy house and my house is unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm happy only outside her and outside this house, I love school, the make
      me feel Happy. She judges me off based on my friends but she knows nothing
      about them she doesn't even know anything about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes i find myself saying i hate her but i don't i love her, But i
      hate the way she treats me she has never been actively involved in my
      puberty stage, My teenage stage maybe only as a baby that's why is say i
      grew up alone maybe with my siblings and my phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sisters groomed me, my brother lectured me, my phone taught me
      everything i know today. Everything i've been through no one except GOD
      knows about it i'm someone who overthinks and have trust issues
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If i tell you my Mom doesnt know i get migrains, i have low iron
      defficency and when i'mm on my period i cry and i fell like im dieing but
      nobody knows that because i keep qiet and i face the pains alone without
      anyone to lean on. I cant sleep when i have cramp i'll just keep rolling
      and crying from night to morning. Anyways enough od my Mother to the next
      person my Brother.
    </p>

    <h5>My Sisters</h5>
    <p>
      I have no much Problems with them except that Chisom reacts at everything.
      Amoge overreacts and keeps to herself till its too much, out of everyone
      she's suffered the most I remember when she was depressed forr months when
      Mummy used to insult her about her academics
    </p>
    <p>
      She had Exam fever and when she was depressed she acted like demons
      possessed her and she would be rolling on the floor i thought she wanted
      attention till one day she almost killed herself. I used to be scared at
      death.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As for me, IM GOING THROUGH ALOT, I JUST WANT TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE BECAUSE
      NO ONNE UNDERSTANDS ME AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN MYSELF
    </p>
